        basically, my girlfiend's birthday is in june. I want to create a website showing my appreciation for her and also telling her what her birthday gift is going to be, hopefully a concert. so the 'final' page will be a concert description, there will be a home page that leads to other pages about her w photos and such. 
        <ul>
            home pages
            concert page
            photo album pages
            and other like 'fun fact' pages
        </ul>
    </p>
